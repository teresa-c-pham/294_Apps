# Testing Application

## Testing City of Chicago API
### Pros
* The buttons for the color, style, state, and make work well. I like the pictures and color choice for the background.
* The background is nice.

### Cons
* The first query output fills the page, but at the end of the data screen, the output falls off the screen and there is just a white background. When multiple queries are done, the list only appends and doesn't remove the previous query results.
* The queries are hard to see because the background is too bold. The text in the first screen is a little small and the picture sticks out too much.
* 
### Suggestions
* Add functionality to update the list and remove previous query
* Make the background a bit lighter to see the query entries easier


## Testing New York Times API
### Pros
* I like the pictures and the New York Times logo. The query search is straightforward and very minimalistic. The query entries are clickable.
* Very pretty. The logo is very clear and the font is easy to see.

### Cons
* Has similar problems to the Chicago API.
* The queries are hard to see.

### Suggestions
* Use a solid background to see queries easier
## Visualization
### Pros
* The camera asks for permission before functioning. The camera is very clear and captures the image well.

### Cons
* The camera visual appears to have no correlation to the rest of the app.
* Camera mirrors my appearance. There is a big space next to the camera with no functionality.


### Suggestions
* Add a chart or visualization relevant to the rest of the app.
* Flip the image of the camera.
* Add some information to the side. The camera could be a small function in the app that supplements the actual content.

## Overall
The app is still very minimalistic and has parts that work well separately, but together have no correlation and still requires touching up to make sure the database is outputted and updated correctly.
